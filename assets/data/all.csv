i was playing runescape and i was in the pvp zone whith my * bank * and suddently a player came and 1 shot me. i panic and i went back to a bank to get any kind of backup equipment i had and run back to the pvp zone hopefully, i would manage to get my shit back.... apparently i got confused and i did not had my * bank * on me when i died, but some shitty equipment. 
that was a huge relief"

Mel0n,THEY'RE SUCH CUTIES
Nodtriel,"Had a dream last night that i was back in high school, the students were the same but the location was different, hard to explain but it was as if it was a huge yard with multiple rooms. 
Now what was cool was that I had Talyn in my dream, my living ship from No Man's Sky and I could summon him and communicate telepathically. 
It was apparently the second week and for some reason I missed the first week of school where we had to pick between two classes
Iron Manipulation (as in smelting and stuff) and Plant Studies. 
I go to the school reception (copy-paste from irl), and I tell them that i missed last week what do I do? They say no matter what you want to get into Plant Studies. In my dream I apparently wanted to be a herbalist or something when I grow up so I really wanted to get in to the Plant Studies class anyway. 
I get there and the teacher is some short older crazy lady, I tell her I want to join and she takes me to take some test to determine what class I need to do. Worth noting that most students were in this class.
Just before I woke up I found out that the test was to put you in the opposite class of what you would prefer to do."

“It’s not cockiness, it’s not a power trip — it’s the opposite: a healthy, satisfied, low-key way you feel yourself. Some may call this ‘oh he/she fucks’ vibe, but that is different: you can fuck, but not have BDE,” Allison P. Davis writes"

Kahlan,"I think our managers forget we are legally allowed breaks.
We are allowed 2 paid breaks for 15 min each and one unpaid lunch for 45
I started my shift at 7am
Took my first  15 min at 9am
Was scheduled my ""lunch"" at 10:15am  (why this retarded time? because 11am phones go live and they want everyone to be ready and to make sure i am doing maximum hours on the phones during my shift they shoved my 2 breaks before the 11am timestamp)
I am also covering social media as a cover agent, what that means is that every shift there has to be 3 main agents on SO-ME and one cover, the cover goes on SO-ME when the others are off on lunch as there must always be 3 agents on SO-ME 
I was told to cover this from 12:15-14:30

But at 10:10 am  I was told to do some training that will take over an hour and go straight to calls once it's 11, meaning i will miss my initial lunch.

At 10:45 they told me to stop my training to go back on chats for 15 mins and go on calls at 11 and i will finish training after 14:30

I'm still due a lunch and one more 15 min break, but my shift ends at 15:45 so that just leaves 1 hours 15 minutes after 14:30 to squash those breaks in and finish my training.
So what i did was took my lunch at 11:30 as the most hectic time for calls is 11-11:30 and that also means i will be on time to cover so-me and can worry about the final break later as it's just 15 mins.
20 mins into my lunch break ""you know what just go finish the training now and make sure you are done before you need to cover so-me"""
